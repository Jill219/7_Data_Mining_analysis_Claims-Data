### Objects:  
  * Use the CMS dataset from 2008-2010 (https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/SynPUFs/DE_Syn_PUF) to do some data mining and analysis of ovarian cancer claims data.  
  * This is a real dataset and is mirrored after the actual CMS claims database.    
  * We try to categorize ovarian cancer patients based on diagnosis and treatment information as available in the claims.
